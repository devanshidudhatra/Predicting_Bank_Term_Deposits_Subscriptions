# Predicting Bank Term Deposits Subscriptions

This project aims to predict whether clients will subscribe to term deposits based on demographic and marketing data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model assists in understanding client behavior and improving marketing strategies.

---

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast client subscriptions to term deposits. This involves:

- Analyzing demographic and marketing data.
- Building and training a machine learning model.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Visualizing results for better interpretation.
